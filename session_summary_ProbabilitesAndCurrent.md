# Session Summary: Comprehensive Overview of C++ Pauli Solver Development

## Objective

The primary objective of this session was to develop a C++ implementation of the Pauli solver that produces consistent results with the reference QmeQ Python implementation. This involved ensuring that the probabilities, energies, kernel matrix, and right-hand side (RHS) match between the two implementations. The session also focused on addressing numerical stability issues and comparing different solver approaches.

## Key Problems Solved

1.  **Matching Probabilities:**
    *   The initial focus was on ensuring that the probabilities calculated by the C++ solver matched those from the QmeQ Python solver. This involved verifying the correctness of the kernel matrix and the solver implementation.

2.  **Numerical Stability:**
    *   The session addressed numerical stability issues, particularly when dealing with singular matrices. A least squares solver was implemented to improve stability and handle singular cases more effectively.

3.  **Current Calculation Discrepancy:**
    *   A significant discrepancy was identified in the current calculation between the C++ and Python implementations. This was resolved by aligning the C++ implementation with the Python approach.

## Solution

The following steps were taken to achieve the objectives:

1.  **Least Squares Solver Implementation:**
    *   A least squares solver was implemented in C++ to improve numerical stability and handle singular matrices. This involved modifying the `gauss_solver.hpp` file to include a least squares solver function.

2.  **Comparison Script Modification:**
    *   The `compare_solvers.py` script was modified to replace the existing linear solver with a least squares solver using NumPy. This allowed for a more accurate comparison between the C++ and Python implementations, especially for singular matrices.

3.  **Kernel Matrix and RHS Verification:**
    *   The kernel matrix and RHS were verified to match between the C++ and Python implementations. This involved debugging the matrix construction and ensuring that the same inputs were used in both implementations.

4.  **Current Calculation Alignment:**
    *   The C++ implementation of the `generate_current` function in `cpp/pauli_solver.hpp` was modified to align with the Python approach in `qmeq/approach/base/pauli.py`. This involved iterating through charge states and calculating the current contributions based on transitions between states in adjacent charge states.

## Relevant Files and Functions

*   **C++ Implementation:**
    *   `cpp/pauli_solver.hpp`:
        *   `PauliSolver::generate_current`: Modified to align with the Python implementation for current calculation.
        *   `PauliSolver::solve_kern`: Used to solve the kernel matrix and obtain probabilities.
    *   `cpp/gauss_solver.hpp`: Implemented least squares solver to improve numerical stability.
*   **Python (QmeQ) Implementation:**
    *   `qmeq/approach/base/pauli.py`:
        *   `ApproachPauliBase.generate_current`: Reference implementation for the current calculation.
        *   `ApproachPauliBase.solve_kern`: Solves the kernel matrix and obtains probabilities.
*   `compare_solvers.py`: This script was used to compare the results from the C++ and Python implementations.

## Incorrect Paths and Findings

*   Initially, there was an attempt to use the electron counts to calculate the current in the C++ implementation, which proved to be incorrect and led to the discrepancy. This approach was abandoned in favor of mirroring the Python implementationâ€™s logic.
*   The initial focus was on using a direct solver (Gaussian elimination), but it was found to be less stable than the least squares solver, especially for singular matrices.

## Conclusion

Throughout this session, significant progress was made in developing a C++ implementation of the Pauli solver that produces consistent results with the QmeQ Python solver. By implementing a least squares solver, verifying the kernel matrix and RHS, and aligning the current calculation logic, the C++ solver now provides accurate and reliable results. The session also highlighted the importance of addressing numerical stability issues and carefully comparing different solver approaches.
